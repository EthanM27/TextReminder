# TextReminder
Personal Python application to remind me through SMS Message to do custom activities throughout the day. I can text the number back and it will track my trends in a Google Sheet file.

This program requires the spreadsheet.py and textremind.py to be run simultaneously, as spreadsheet.py checks for an SMS message and updates a google sheet while textremind.py sends the reminders and updates the sheet every day.

All the files in the example_files folder are needed by the program to run. A brief description of the purpose of each file can be found in the file themselves.
These files need to be taken out of the example_files folder and placed into the project's root directory.
